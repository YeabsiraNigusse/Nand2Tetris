- Computers do arthimetic oprations
- 4-bit computer can represent 16 different numbers numbers
- 2-complement can be used to represent signed numbers - `here we just have half of the total number of representation since 4-bit computer can represent numbers from -8 to 7`
- signed numebr of a number can be found just by fliping all the bits of the number bit and add 1 to the result.
- this takes only addition opration which make 2-complement method powerfull and easy(interesting finding).

``` The breakthrough was realizing that arithmetic itself can be built entirely from logical operations. Once Boolean logic was shown to implement addition and other math, it merged abstract mathematics with physical logic gates â€” making it possible to construct full arithmetic units in hardware.```
