- Computers do arthimetic oprations
- 4-bit computer can represent 16 different numbers numbers
- 2-complement can be used to represent signed numbers - `here we just have half of the total number of representation since 4-bit computer can represent numbers from -8 to 7`
- signed numebr of a number can be found just by fliping all the bits of the number bit and add 1 to the result.
- this takes only addition opration which make 2-complement method powerfull and easy(interesting finding).
