### Insight

- We can represent on and off state of voltage using numbers
- boolean algebra is used to design and build digital circutes(Claude Elwood Shannon) - amazing contribution. 
`
- We have 4 function or state of possibilities for one bit input which are 
```
    0 -> 1
    0 -> 0
    1 -> 1
    1 -> 0
```
- we have 16 functions or state of possible outcomes for two bit input which are

    ```
    00 -> 0   1   0   0   0   1   0   0 
    01 -> 0   1   0   0   1   0   0   1
    10 -> 0   1   0   1   0   0   1   0
    11 -> 0   1   1   0   0   0   1   1

    etc .. up to 16 total complete outcomes
    ```

- so with this two bit number we can represent 16 different numbers starting from 0000 
- we can name each possible outputs and build a logic gate for them like AND gate for 0001 for 4 possible 2-bit inputs etc ...
